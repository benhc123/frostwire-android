frostwire-common
================

common components and libraries shared across frostwire clients.

You can work inside common/ and commit to the 'frostwire-desktop' or 'frostwire-android' repository. 
Once your 'common/' changes are ready to be pushed, go to the root folder of frostwire-desktop and invoke:
./common/push.sh

IMPORTANT: If you are making changes to 'common/' make sure your commits include only files from common, otherwise
the history of the 'frostwire-common' repository might have commit messages related to missing files, it won't be the
end of the world, but it's better if all commits make perfect sense.

This will grab the commits related to the 'common/' folder and push them to the github.com/frostwire/frostwire-common.git repository.

If you need to get the latest changes from the github.com/frostwire/frostwire-common.git repository invoke from the root folder of frostwire-desktop:
./common/pull.sh

-----------------------

#Setup

git subtree split --prefix=common --rejoin --branch common-backport
git push https://github.com/frostwire/frostwire-common.git common-backport:master
git branch -D common-backport
```

#Pull

There are a couple of helper scripts inside.
